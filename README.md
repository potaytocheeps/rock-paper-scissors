# rock-paper-scissors
Project: Rock Paper Scissors from The Odin Project curriculum in the
JavaScript Basics section of the Foundations course.

This is the third project in The Odin Project curriculum and the first
that deals with working with JavaScript by creating a simple
implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. The project
will begin as a basic console implementation of the game to practice
the JavaScript skills learned thus far and to get all of the necessary
logic working to complete a full match of Rock Paper Scissors against
the computer.

The project will later be revisited to add a Graphical User Interface
for it to have better visuals and interactivity for the player. This
project will cover many of the foundational concepts of JavaScript,
such as working with variables, different data types, and functions.
